## Requirements

* Xcode 4.5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* EventKit.framework
* QuartzCore.framework

## Demo

Build and run the `iPadCalendar` project in Xcode. 
I've included a JSON file for adding todo times, start times, end times, and event labels.

## Installation

Drop the `MELiPadCalendar` folder into your project.  Make sure 'Copy items if needed' and 'Create groups' is checked.

Add `QuartzCore.framework` and `EventKit.framework` if you don't already have them in your project.

## Use

Have your view controller conform to the MELiPadCalendarDelegate so that you can change months and receive data on when a row in the day is tapped.

Before initiating the calendar, initiate three arrays, one for the dates which will contain data, another for the todo start times and another for the todo end times.

You can send the calendar arrays of todo dates, start hours, end hours, and header labels.


Initiate the calendar:
The frame and date need to be captured for transitioning between months.

```objc
	self.calendar = [[MELiPadCalendarView alloc]initWithXoffset:128 andYoffset:0 withDimension:768];
    self.calendar.delegate = self;
    self.orientationDate = [NSDate date];
    NSString *stringFromDate = [self.dateFormatter stringFromDate:self.orientationDate];
    self.calendar.selectedDate = [self.dateFormatter dateFromString:stringFromDate];
    [self.calendar setUpTheTodoDates:self.theTodoDates withStartTimes:self.theStartHours andEndTimes:self.theEndHours andHeaders:self.theHeaders];
    [self.view addSubview:self.calendar];
```

When a user attempts to move to the previous or next month, the calendar will call `transitionMonth:` on the delegate.
In these methods, the entire calendar must be removed and reinitiated in order to accomodate larger months such as June, and any new data.

``` objc
- (void)transitionMonth:(BOOL)forward
{
    CGRect frameChosen = self.calendar.frame;
    
    [self.calendar removeFromSuperview];
    self.calendar = nil;
    
    if (forward)
    {
        [self.dateComponents setMonth:1];
    }
    else
    {
        [self.dateComponents setMonth:-1];
    }
    
    self.orientationDate = [self.calendarForOrientation dateByAddingComponents:self.dateComponents toDate:self.orientationDate options:0];
    NSString *stringFromDate = [self.dateFormatter stringFromDate:self.orientationDate];
    self.calendar = [[MELiPadCalendarView alloc]initWithXoffset:frameChosen.origin.x andYoffset:frameChosen.origin.y withDimension:frameChosen.size.width];
    self.calendar.delegate = self;
    self.calendar.selectedDate = [self.dateFormatter dateFromString:stringFromDate];
    [self.calendar setUpTheTodoDates:self.theTodoDates withStartTimes:self.theStartHours andEndTimes:self.theEndHours andHeaders:self.theHeaders];
    [self.view addSubview:self.calendar];
}
```
##Customizing

- Fonts, text colors, and background colors of nearly every element can be customized.

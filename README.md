=======

Calendar for the iPad with table views to display and return scheduling data.

## Requirements

* Xcode 4.5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* EventKit.framework
* QuartzCore.framework

## Demo

Build and run the `iPadCalendar` project in Xcode. 
I've included a JSON file for adding todo times, start times, end times, and event labels.

## Installation

Drop the `MELiPadCalendarView` folder into your project.  Make sure 'Copy items if needed' and 'Create groups' is checked.

Make sure `QuartzCore.framework` and `EventKit.framework` are linked to your project.

## Use

The demo provides a datasource by initiating four arrays, one for the dates which will contain data, another for the task start times, another for the task end times, and one for the task labels.

Initiate the calendar with its x Offset, y Offset and side dimension.  To stay in tune with Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines,](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/) I keep the view a perfect square and prevent it from being less than 512 or greater than 768.  That will fit two calendars in landscape.

```objc
     MELiPadCalendarView *calendar = [[MELiPadCalendarView alloc]initWithXoffset:0 andYoffset:0 withDimension:768];
    calendar.delegate = self;
    self.orientationDate = [NSDate date];
    NSString *stringFromDate = [self.dateFormatter stringFromDate:self.orientationDate];
    calendar.selectedDate = [self.dateFormatter dateFromString:stringFromDate];
    [calendar setUpTheTodoDates:self.theTodoDates withStartTimes:self.theStartHours andEndTimes:self.theEndHours andHeaders:self.theHeaders];
    [self.view addSubview:calendar];
```

Have your view controller conform to the MELiPadCalendarDelegate so that you can change months and receive data on when a row in the day is tapped.

For when a user taps on a task on one of the dates:

``` objc
- (void)calendar:(MELiPadCalendarView *)calendar didTapTaskWithHours:(NSString *)hours;
```

For when a user attempts move to the previous or next month:

``` objc
- (void)transitionMonth:(BOOL)forward
{
    CGRect frameChosen = self.calendar.frame;
    
    [self.calendar removeFromSuperview];
    self.calendar = nil;
    
    if (forward)
    {
        [self.dateComponents setMonth:1];
    }
    else
    {
        [self.dateComponents setMonth:-1];
    }
    
    self.orientationDate = [self.calendarForOrientation dateByAddingComponents:self.dateComponents toDate:self.orientationDate options:0];
    NSString *stringFromDate = [self.dateFormatter stringFromDate:self.orientationDate];
    self.calendar = [[MELiPadCalendarView alloc]initWithXoffset:frameChosen.origin.x andYoffset:frameChosen.origin.y withDimension:frameChosen.size.width];
    self.calendar.delegate = self;
    self.calendar.selectedDate = [self.dateFormatter dateFromString:stringFromDate];
    [self.calendar setUpTheTodoDates:self.theTodoDates withStartTimes:self.theStartHours andEndTimes:self.theEndHours andHeaders:self.theHeaders];
    [self.view addSubview:self.calendar];
}
```
##Customizing

- Fonts, text colors, and background colors for most elements can be customized.

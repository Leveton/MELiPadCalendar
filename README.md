## Requirements

* Xcode 4.5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* EventKit.framework
* QuartzCore.framework

## Demo

Build and run the `iPadCalendar` project in Xcode. 
I've included a JSON file for adding todo times, start times, end times, and event labels.

## Installation

Drop the `MELiPadCalendarView` folder into your project.  Make sure 'Copy items if needed' and 'Create groups' is checked.

Make sure `QuartzCore.framework` and `EventKit.framework` are linked to your project.

## Use

The demo provides a datasource by initiating four arrays, one for the dates which will contain data, another for the task start times, another for the task end times, and one for the task labels.

Initiate the calendar with its x Offset, y Offset and side dimension.  To stay in tune with Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines,](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/) I keep the view a perfect square and prevent it from being less than 512 or greater than 768.  That will fit two calendars in landscape.

```objc
MELiPadCalendarView *calendar = [[MELiPadCalendarView alloc]initWithXoffset:0 andYoffset:0 withDimension:768];
calendar.delegate = self;
self.orientationDate = [NSDate date];
NSString *stringFromDate = [self.dateFormatter stringFromDate:self.orientationDate];
calendar.selectedDate = [self.dateFormatter dateFromString:stringFromDate];
[calendar setUpTheTodoDates:self.theTodoDates withStartTimes:self.theStartHours andEndTimes:self.theEndHours andHeaders:self.theHeaders];
[self.view addSubview:calendar];
```

Have your view controller conform to the MELiPadCalendarDelegate so that you can change months and receive data when a row in the day is tapped.

if a user taps on any date, the delegate gets the date chosen, if they tap on a task, the delegate also gets the hour range for that task:

``` objc
- (void)calendar:(MELiPadCalendarView *)calendar didTapTaskWithHours:(NSString *)hours forDate:(NSDate *)date;
```

For transitioning months, you can either prepare the calendar in the delegate like I do in the demo project, or you can fork this control and prepare it in the view itself.

``` objc
- (void)calendar:(MELiPadCalendarView *)calendar didTapTransitionMonth:(BOOL)forward;
```

##Customizing

- Fonts, text colors, and background colors for most elements can be customized.
